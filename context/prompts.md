- Read the file @GEMINI.md and @doc_webaudio.md  and let me know when you've finished this task.
- Please review the codebase in @app and then let me know when you are finished with this task. I'll then give you the next task.
- I would like you to implement a "AnalyserNode - Audio Analysis and Visualization" feature into the existing app. Purpose: To visualize the full spectrum audible waveform coming from the "Destination" output node. Place this in the App layout, as a full width component, above the 'Patch Bay' component. Let me know if you require more details to create and implement this feature.

Your success criteria checklist will be:
1. Implement the AnalyserNode feature
2. Test the feature to ensure it functions as expected
3. Ensure all other app functionality is unchanged
